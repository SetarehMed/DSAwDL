Damage Sites Analysis with Deep Learning. 
In this program we tried to get the statistic over damage sites in DP800 steel, where the damage sites are categorized to Inclusions and Non-Inclusions, Which is a measure of ductility. 
The used network is Inception V3 in which about 10 layers are frozen and the dataset in created in IMM-RWTH using labelImg software by manual definition of the damage sites.


This envirement is the corresponding MATALAB-version for 1st  classification network behind the presented WebÃŸInterface which is Python-Tensorflow based. 
The idea behind this Github is to introduce the pipeline in a more conviniet envirement and welcome other researchers to contribute.
